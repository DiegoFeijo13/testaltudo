# Test Altudo
An app to get a page URL and show all images in it and the top 10 most used words.

# How to run?

Open the app on `bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish\TesteAltudo.exe` and a url will be shown in a prompt window (something like http://localhost:5000).
Access the url in a web browser and have fun :)
